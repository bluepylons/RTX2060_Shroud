This is a mounting shroud to mount two 92mm fans onto the single-fan [EVGA RTX 2060 XC](https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=06G-P4-2063-KR). This may work on the RTX 2060 SC but is unconfirmed that the mounting holes have not been changed. This also may work on 1660 and 1660 Ti variants that use a simlar cooler, but has not been tested or confirmed to work on those either.

This was motivated by necessity as virtually no third-party coolers fit on most RTX2060 variants since the reference PCB has the die and heatsink mounting holes much closer to the front of the card than on most GeForce cards, preventing a heatsink transplant or use of a third-party heatsink. 

There are two versions - a version meant for 3D printing, and DXF files designed to be laser-cut out of 1/8" (3.2mm) plastic and glued together.

You are free to use the files for any purpose. These files are provided as-is with no implied fitness for any purpose. Use and manufacture at your own risk. Solidwork files use SW2018. 

This mounts to the existing heatsink using M2x0.4 screws. I recommend at least a 6mm long screw. 

To remove the existing shroud , you have to peel off the "EVGA GEFORCE RTX" sticker and remove the 3 screws underneath, as well as 3 screws opposite that are not covered by a sticker. To remove the fan there are 3 screws underneath the fan. This may void the warranty. I am not responsible if the warranty is voided as a result of any actions or any damage from either removing the heatsink nor building this.
